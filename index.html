          <p> I'm Hannah and I've always got my nose buried in a book! My deep passion for books sparked my interest in sharing my book reviews on social media and I have been blessed by the wonderful community and found new found friends. Books have the power to transform lives and with the portrayals of different worlds , each story has the power to leave a mark on our hearts and minds. From heart-warming contemporary fiction to mind -bending dystopian, I love in to indulge in a wide array of genres. I believe there's beauty in diversity and I am always on the lookout for narratives that challenge perspectives and broaden horizons. That being said, I am a born again Christian and do cross the line on books that I feel that stray away from my faith or I have decided that they have questionable content in them.  One thing I enjoy about the bookish community is that it consists of a wide range of readers from those who enjoy sweet clean romance to terrifying dark thrillers. In my reviews, I strive to provide insightful and honest thoughts hoping to guide you into next favorite read!

          <p>This block of text goes on and on and does not have any visual separation between what would normally make up a new paragraph. Instead, it will continue to have more text added to it and look like it has not been formatted. It just keeps going and going and going and will start new topics without separating them with paragraphs. You see, even though this is nice, let's talk about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), often called style sheets, for a minute. Style sheets are used to affect the appearance of web pages. CSS code contains selectors and definitions for the various tags, classes, or ids that are used when marking up and HTML document.

          JavaScript, on the other hand, can add additional functionality to a Web page. Since it is a programming language, you can write code to perform any number of tasks. You could change the content within a block of text, change an image when the user places their mouse over a specific part of the page, validate form content, send alert messages, and more. It can be learned through books, tutorials, or classes that are offered in many place
